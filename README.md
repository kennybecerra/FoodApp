# FoodApp
Fictional site about a food delivery company. This is a sample website showcasing skillset in Frontent Development. See the Web App [here](https://kennybecerra.github.io/FoodApp/)

## Description
The web application uses **HTML5** syntax along with **CSS Grid/Flexbox** for layouts. I personally like to use **SASS** as a **preprocessor** for productivty and **postcss/autoprefixer** for broswer compatibility. I implement **Mobile first design** and use **responsive design** throughout the development process. You can also see my web development setup which includes **Webpack 4** with seperate config files for production and development. A link to my Starter Project Template can be found [here](https://github.com/kennybecerra/ProjectTemplate).

## Folder Structure

There are 3 main folders: `dist` folder contains production ready files, `src` folder contains the files I used in development, and `config` containes webpack configuration files. In order to use github pages I have copied all `dist` files into root directory as well. Feel free to browse the `src` folder to see non-minified code.
